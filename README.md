I seek opportunities to solve problems in many domains, create great products, research, and develop new algorithms.

Now I'm working on tools for developers at [@JetBrains](https://github.com/JetBrains).
We make [@Qodana](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/qodana-scan). Also, I [maintain](https://github.com/tiulpin) a few OSS projects here.
                
âš¡ Fun fact: If your GitHub repository has more than 50 stars, I cloned it.
