## Introduction
- Differences in tools for writing English words (e.g., Google Docs) versus code (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA)
- Importance of investing time in mastering a code editor

---

## Learning a New Editor
- Start with a tutorial
- Use the editor for all text editing
- Look up better ways to do tasks

---

# Choosing an Editor

---

## Editor Wars
- Programmers have strong opinions on text editors
- Popular editors today: Visual Studio Code, Vim, ... Fleet?

---

## Vim
- Rich history, still actively developed
- Vim emulation modes in many tools

---

# Philosophy of Vim

---

## Vim's Design
- Focused on reading/editing over writing
- Modal editor: different modes for inserting text vs manipulating text
- Programmable and avoids mouse usage

---

# Modal Editing in Vim

---

## Different Operating Modes
- Normal: moving around and making edits
- Insert: inserting text
- Others: Replace, Visual, Command-line

---

## Mode Switching
- `<ESC>` to switch to Normal mode
- Other keys (`i`, `R`, `v`, `V`, `<C-v>`, `:`) for different modes

---

# Basics of Vim

---

## Inserting Text
- `i` to enter Insert mode
- `<ESC>` to return to Normal mode

---

## Buffers, Tabs, and Windows
- Buffers for open files
- Tabs contain windows
- Windows show buffers

---

## Command-line Mode
- `:` in Normal mode to enter
- Commands for file operations and quitting

---

## Movement Commands
- Basic: `hjkl` (left, down, up, right)
- Words, lines, screen, file, line numbers, find, and search

---

## Selection in Visual Modes
- `v` for Visual
- `V` for Visual Line
- `Ctrl-v` for Visual Block

---

## Editing Commands
- `d{motion}`, `c{motion}`, `x`, `s`, `u`, `<C-r>`, `y`, `p`

---

## Counts and Modifiers
- Combine commands with counts (`3w`, `5j`)
- Modifiers like `i` (inner) and `a` (around)

---

# Customizing Vim

- `~/.vimrc` for configuration
- Starting point: well-documented basic config

---

# Extending Vim with Plugins

- Built-in package management in Vim
- Favorite plugins: ctrlp.vim, ack.vim, nerdtree, vim-easymotion

---

# Vim-mode in Other Programs

- Shell integration (Bash, Zsh, Fish)
- GNU Readline library
- Other software with vim-like keybindings

---

# Advanced Vim

- Search and replace
- Multiple windows
- Macros

---

# Resources for Learning Vim

- `vimtutor`
- [Vim Adventures](https://vim-adventures.com/)
- [Vim Tips Wiki](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Vim_Tips_Wiki)
- [Practical Vim](https://pragprog.com/titles/dnvim2/) (book)

# Topic 4

Fragments of Development Operations

---

## Introduction to Build Systems
- The concept of a "build process" in projects
- Sequence of operations from inputs to outputs
- The role of build systems in automating these processes

---

## What is a Build System?
- A tool to define dependencies, targets, and rules
- Manages and optimizes the build process
- Examples include `make`, specialized tools for languages or larger projects

---

## The Make Build System
- One of the most common build systems
- Uses a `Makefile` to define rules, targets, and dependencies
- Example of a simple `Makefile`:

```make
hello:
	echo "Hello, World"
```

---

## How `make` Works
- Determines the necessary steps to build a target
- Avoids redundant builds by checking dependencies
- Common operations like building a PDF from LaTeX sources

---

## Dependency Management
- Projects depend on external code or libraries
- Repositories and tools manage these dependencies
- Versioning ensures compatibility and stability

---

## Semantic Versioning
- Version format: major.minor.patch
- Rules for updating each number based on changes
- Helps maintain compatibility and predictability

---

## Lock Files and Vendoring
- Lock files specify exact versions used in a project
- Vendoring involves copying dependencies into the project
- Ensures control and consistency over external code

---

# Continuous Integration Systems

---

## Overview of CI Systems
- Automate tasks that run on code changes
- Common in larger projects for testing, deployment, etc.
- Examples: Travis CI, Azure Pipelines, GitHub Actions

---

## CI Configuration
- Defined through files in the repository
- Specifies actions on events like push or pull request
- Automates testing, building, deploying, and more

---

## Example: GitHub Pages
- Automatic deployment of websites on push to `master`
- Runs Jekyll to build the site, deploys to GitHub domain
- Simplifies website updates and maintenance
