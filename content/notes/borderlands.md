> A terrorist country is already the largest country in the world. By territory. On the other hand, on Wikipedia, in the Russia Inventions section, Russia's latest development is the 2020 vector vaccine and the Armata tank in 2016. It would seem that the money they spend on this meaningless war could be spent on settling the territory, making incredible scientific progress, inventing a cure for cancer, but they decided to spend it on destroying another country.
