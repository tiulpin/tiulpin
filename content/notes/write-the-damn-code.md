> I mean, "learn to decompose the problem" — sure. "Iterate on your prompts" — not so much. Write the actual code instead:
>
> Ask AI for an initial version and then refactor it to match your expectations.
> Write the initial version yourself and ask AI to review and improve it.
> Write the critical parts and ask AI to do the rest.
> Write an outline of the code and ask AI to fill the missing parts.
> You probably see the pattern now. Get involved with the code, don't leave it all to AI.
>
> If, given the prompt, AI does the job perfectly on first or second iteration — fine. Otherwise, stop refining the prompt. Go write some code, then get back to the AI. You'll get much better results.

> Don't get me wrong: this is not anti-AI advice. Use it, by all means. Use it a lot if you want to. But don't fall into the trap of endless back-and-forth prompt refinement, trying to get the perfect result from AI by "programming in English". It's an imprecise, slow and terribly painful way to get things done.
