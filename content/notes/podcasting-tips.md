Things I learned from trying to do it a few times already.

- [ ] discuss the interview plan with the guest beforehand
- [ ] build a list of questions for the guest
- [ ] tell the guest about track recording and the need for a quiet environment
- [ ] assign a main presenter to moderate it
- [ ] be silent for 10 seconds at the start
- [ ] talk cheerfully (but don't interrupt or raise your hand in the video)
- [ ] understand when to end and stop
