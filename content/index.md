My name is Viktor Tiulpin. I happen to be a software engineer; more info about me you can find on my main page [tiulp.in](https://tiulp.in/).


Here I am trying to maintain a <i>third brain</i> – my public personal wiki (the second one is private!). Some of the posts you'll find helpful, some materials are for the people who I made courses for in the past.


The main goal is to keep the knowledge in one place and make it accessible for me, and, thanks to the pressure of the publicity, to keep it organized and clear.
