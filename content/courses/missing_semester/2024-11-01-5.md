## Introduction to Build Systems
- The concept of a "build process" in projects
- Sequence of operations from inputs to outputs
- The role of build systems in automating these processes

---

## What is a Build System?
- A tool to define dependencies, targets, and rules
- Manages and optimizes the build process
- Examples include `make`, specialized tools for languages or larger projects

---

## The Make Build System
- One of the most common build systems
- Uses a `Makefile` to define rules, targets, and dependencies
- Example of a simple `Makefile`:

```make
hello:
	echo "Hello, World"
```

---

## Basic Structure of a Makefile

A Makefile consists of a series of rules.
Each rule defines how to produce a target file from source files.

```make
target: dependencies
command
```
- target: The file or action to be created.
- dendencies: Files that the target depends on.
- command: The shell command to build the target.

---

## Let's Write a Makefile

- `all`: The default target that builds the hello executable.
- `hello`: Depends on hello.o; links the object file to create the executable.
- `hello.o`: Compiles hello.c into an object file.
- `clean`: Removes generated files.

```make
all: hello

hello: hello.o
    gcc -o hello hello.o

hello.o: hello.c
    gcc -c hello.c

clean:
    rm -f hello hello.o
```

---

## Variables in Makefiles

- `CC`: Compiler variable (e.g., gcc).
- CFLAGS: Compiler flags (e.g., `-Wall` for warnings, `-g` for debugging).
- `$@, $^, $<`: Automatic variables

Automatic variables simplify rules:

- `$@`: The target filename.
- `$^`: All dependencies.
- `$<`: The first dependency.

`PHONY` targets: Actions that are not filenames.

---

## Best Practices

- Use Variables: Simplifies updates and maintenance.
- Pattern Rules: Avoid repetition for similar build rules.
- Phony Targets: Ensures that commands are executed even if a file with the same name exists.
- Comments: Document your Makefile for clarity
- If your Makefile becomes too long, consider other build systems

---

## Dependency Management
- Projects depend on external code or libraries
- Repositories and tools manage these dependencies
- Versioning ensures compatibility and stability

---

## Semantic Versioning
- Version format: major.minor.patch
- Rules for updating each number based on changes
- Helps maintain compatibility and predictability

---

## Lock Files and Vendoring
- Lock files specify exact versions used in a project
- Vendoring involves copying dependencies into the project
- Ensures control and consistency over external code

---

# Continuous Integration Systems

---

## Overview of CI Systems
- Automate tasks that run on code changes
- Common in larger projects for testing, deployment, etc.
- Examples: Travis CI, Azure Pipelines, GitHub Actions

---

## CI Configuration
- Defined through files in the repository
- Specifies actions on events like push or pull request
- Automates testing, building, deploying, and more

---

## Example: GitHub Pages
- Automatic deployment of websites on push to `master`
- Runs Jekyll to build the site, deploys to GitHub domain
- Simplifies website updates and maintenance
