## Introduction
- Docker's rise since its 2013 launch.
- Popular for its automation and container deployment capabilities.
- Offers portability, consistency, and efficiency.

---

## Basic Architecture
- Docker: Automates deployment inside software containers.
- Containers: Isolated instances enabled by the OS kernel.
- Multiple implementations; Docker is a prominent one.

---

## Docker Images and Dockerfiles
- Docker operates using 'images', which are like blueprints for containers.
- Dockerfiles define how to build these images.

---

### Dockerfile


- Example Dockerfile: Sets up OpenJDK, installs Python, and prepares the environment.

```docker
FROM openjdk:8u212-jdk-slim
RUN apt-get update \
  && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    Python3=3.5.3-1 \
    Python3-pip=9.0.1-2+deb9u1 \
  && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip3 install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Docker Registries and Hosts
- Images stored in repositories, known as Docker registries.
- Docker Hub is a popular public registry.
- Docker host: A Linux machine running the Docker daemon.

---

## Docker Architecture Overview
- Illustration of Docker's basic architecture.
- Interaction between client, host, and registry.

---

## Container Isolation in Docker
- Key concepts:
    - cgroups
    - namespaces
    - image-layers
    - virtual network bridges
- These tools collectively enable container isolation and functionality.

---

### Control Groups (cgroups)
- cgroups: Assign resources to process groups for isolation.
- Example: Allocating specific CPU cores and RAM to different applications.
- Essential for resource management and isolation.

![cgroups Example](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NzsoSDzi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/49ymdqhhg9eb4cgemflr.png)

---

### Namespaces in Docker
- Namespaces: Isolate and virtualize system resources.
- Types: PID, hostname, user IDs, network, IPC, filesystems.
- PID namespaces example: Process isolation within containers.

---

## PID Namespaces
- Linux organizes processes in a tree hierarchy.
- PID namespaces virtualize process IDs, creating isolation.
- Example: Isolating processes in a container from the host system.

```plaintext
1 /sbin/init
+-- 196 /usr/sbin/syslogd -s
+-- 354 /usr/sbin/cron -s
+-- 391 login
    +-- 400 bash
        +-- 701 /usr/local/bin/pstree
```

---

## Filesystem Namespaces
- Virtualize parts of the filesystem tree for isolation.
- Allows mapping a subtree as a root in a namespace.
- Example: Different 'virtual' filesystem roots in Linux.

![Filesystem Namespace Example](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sMKo15Wy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/758b8sygjjivyqdp0thz.png)

---

## Other Types of Namespaces
- User namespace: Maps users inside a container to outside users.
- Network namespace: Isolates container's network stack.
- Each namespace type adds a layer of isolation in containers.

---

### Stackable Image Layers and Copy-On-Write
- Docker images are built in layers, each layer adding changes.
- Example: An image layer adding Python on top of an Ubuntu base.
- Efficiency through shared, immutable layers and copy-on-write.

---

### Virtual Network Bridge
- Isolates container's network using a virtual bridge.
- Connects virtual and physical network interfaces.
- Allows network isolation and configuration flexibility.

---

## Connecting the Technical Dots
- Docker simplifies container creation using Linux capabilities.
- It automates the use of cgroups, namespaces, image layers, and network bridges.
- Streamlines deployment without deep Linux expertise.

---

## Opportunities and Challenges of Docker
- Examining the benefits and potential issues with Docker adoption.
- Balancing Docker's capabilities with real-world deployment considerations.

---

## Opportunities with Docker
- Facilitates DevOps and CI/CD practices.
- Predictable deployments: "It works on my machine" problem solved.
- Integrates with major cloud and cluster managers.
- Enables quick scaling and fast failure recovery.

---

## Challenges in Docker Adoption
- Security misconceptions: Containers don't inherently secure applications.
- Risk of deploying inadequate or insecure containerized solutions.
- The "fat container" anti-pattern: Avoid heavy, complex containers.
- Deep Linux knowledge may be required for specific issues.

---

## Frequently Asked Questions About Docker

---

### Containers vs Virtual Machines
- Understanding the conceptual differences.
- Containers: Lightweight, use the host OS kernel, efficient for isolated applications.
- VMs: Heavier, require a hypervisor, suited for complete OS isolation.

![VM vs Container](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iiUS40qD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/d5sazt7ln80e63qvhz1r.png)

---

### Do Containers Truly Isolate?
- Containers provide isolation, but not absolute security.
- Proper configuration is key.
- Containers interact with the host and other containers, creating potential security gaps.

---

### Impact of Containers on Production Stability
- Containers can increase stability but don't guarantee error-free applications.
- Proper configuration and understanding of container interactions are crucial.
- Containers facilitate quick recovery and scaling.

---

## Conclusion
- Docker: A powerful tool for efficient, isolated, and reproducible deployments.
- Requires understanding of its ecosystem and underlying Linux features.
- Not a one-size-fits-all solution; assess requirements before adoption.

"Putting broken software into a Docker container doesn't make it any less broken."

# Kubernetes – practical development intro

---

- **Kubernetes**: For orchestrating containerized apps.
- **Docker**: Great for managing a few containers.
- **Orchestration Needs**: For managing larger systems (100s or 1000+ containers).
- **What Kubernetes Offers**: Scheduling, load balancing, and distribution of containers.

---

## Why Orchestration

- **Container Limitations**: Good for small scale; struggles with large systems.
- **Benefits of Orchestration**:
    - Efficiently manage numerous containers.
    - Automates deployment, scaling and operations.

---

## Introduction to Kubernetes

- **Origin**: Developed from Google's Borg and Omega systems.
- **Naming**: Greek for "Helmsman", steering wheel logo.
- **Language**: Written in Go.
- **Purpose**: Built for handling large numbers of containers efficiently.

---

## Learning kubectl and Basic Concepts

- **kubectl**: A command-line tool for Kubernetes.
- **Cluster**: Consists of a Control ("master") and multiple Nodes.
- **Nodes**: Machines that run containerized applications.

---

Install minikube.

---

## First Kubernetes Application

- **Deploying an App**: Using `kubectl run` command.
- **Behind the Scenes**: Kubernetes schedules and runs the application on a suitable node.
- **Pods**: Smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, holding the containerized app.

---

## Interacting with the Kubernetes Cluster

- **Listing Nodes**: `kubectl get nodes`.
- **Running Applications**: Deploy using `kubectl run`.
- **Viewing Deployments**: `kubectl get deployments`.

---

## Pods and Container Interaction

- **Pod Information**: Retrieving pod details using `kubectl get pods`.
- **HTTP API Access**: Using `kubectl proxy` for API access.
- **Exploring Pods**: `curl` requests to pod endpoints.

---

```shell
kubectl get pods
kubectl proxy
curl http://localhost:8001/version
kubectl get deployments
```

---

## Concepts: Pods, Nodes, Services, Deployments

---

### Pods

- **Atomic Unit**: Smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.
- **Components**: Consists of one or more containers (e.g., Docker) and shared resources like storage and networking.
- **Characteristics**: Co-located, co-scheduled containers within a Pod.

---

### Nodes

- **Definition**: Worker machines (virtual or physical) in a Kubernetes cluster.
- **Components**: Contains Kubelet, Kube proxy, and a container runtime.
- **Functionality**: Managed by the Master, hosts multiple pods.

---

### Deployments

- **Purpose**: Provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.
- **Functionality**: A Deployment controller provides updated status information about the rollout, it will ensure the desired state matches the current state.
- **Rolling Updates**: Deployments support rolling updates to your application, allowing you to deploy a new version of your app with zero downtime.

---

- **Rollbacks**: If something goes wrong, Kubernetes provides the ability to rollback this change.
- **Scaling**: Deployments can help to scale your application horizontally with a declarative command, Kubernetes users don't need to manually create new Pods, but instead they declare the number of Pods they want and Deployments ensure that this number is always met.

---

```shell

kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl delete deployment nginx-deployment
```

---

### Services

- **Purpose**: Handles pod mortality; maintains app accessibility.
- **ReplicaSet**: Ensures pod replication for consistent application running.
- **Service Types**: ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, ExternalName.


---

```shell
kubectl create deployment kubernetes-first-app --image=gcr.io/google-samples/kubernetes-bootcamp:v1 --port=8080
kubectl expose deployment kubernetes-first-app --type="NodePort" --port=8080
kubectl get services
kubectl describe services/kubernetes-first-app
kubectl describe deployment
```

---

### Scaling

We can scale our deployment and see the new pods being used.

```shell
kubectl scale deployments/kubernetes-first-app --replicas=4
```

---

# What k8s is not

---

### Data Storage
- Does not manage data storage volumes directly
- Does not replace traditional data management systems

---

### Databases
- Not a database management solution
- Does not handle database installation, configuration, or management

---

### Secret Management
- Limited capabilities in secret management
- Does not replace dedicated secret management tools

---

### Networking and Load Balancing
- Does not replace dedicated load balancers and network configurators
- Limited control over low-level networking features

---

### Application-Level Services
- Not designed for managing application-level services like message queues
- Does not replace specialized middleware solutions
- Does not automate the writing of custom application logic
- Requires manual intervention for specific business needs
