---

# Modal Editing in Vim

---

## Different Operating Modes
- Normal: moving around and making edits
- Insert: inserting text
- Others: Replace, Visual, Command-line

---

## Mode Switching
- `<ESC>` to switch to Normal mode
- Other keys (`i`, `R`, `v`, `V`, `<C-v>`, `:`) for different modes

---

# Basics of Vim

---

## Inserting Text
- `i` to enter Insert mode
- `<ESC>` to return to Normal mode

---

## Buffers, Tabs, and Windows
- Buffers for open files
- Tabs contain windows
- Windows show buffers

---

## Command-line Mode
- `:` in Normal mode to enter
- Commands for file operations and quitting

---

## Movement Commands
- Basic: `hjkl` (left, down, up, right)
- Words, lines, screen, file, line numbers, find, and search

---

## Selection in Visual Modes
- `v` for Visual
- `V` for Visual Line
- `Ctrl-v` for Visual Block

---

## Editing Commands
- `d{motion}`, `c{motion}`, `x`, `s`, `u`, `<C-r>`, `y`, `p`

---

## Counts and Modifiers
- Combine commands with counts (`3w`, `5j`)
- Modifiers like `i` (inner) and `a` (around)

---

# Customizing Vim

- `~/.vimrc` for configuration
- Starting point: well-documented basic config

---

# Extending Vim with Plugins

- Built-in package management in Vim
- Favorite plugins: ctrlp.vim, ack.vim, nerdtree, vim-easymotion

---

# Vim-mode in Other Programs

- Shell integration (Bash, Zsh, Fish)
- GNU Readline library
- Other software with vim-like keybindings

---

# Advanced Vim
