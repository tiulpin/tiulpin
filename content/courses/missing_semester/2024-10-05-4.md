# Introduction

When writing English text, we often use tools like **Google Docs** or **LibreOffice**,
which are designed for the writing and formatting of natural language documents.

In contrast, when writing code, we use specialized tools such as **IntelliJ IDEA**, **Visual Studio Code**, or **Vim**.
These code editors are optimized for programming languages and offer features like syntax highlighting,
code completion, and debugging support.

Investing time in mastering a code editor is **crucial**
because it can significantly enhance your productivity and efficiency as a programmer.

A powerful editor allows you to 
- write code faster, 
- navigate through codebases more efficiently, 
- reduce errors 
by leveraging advanced features tailored for coding.

# Philosophy of Vim

## Vim's Design

Vim is designed with a focus on efficiency and productivity:
- **Reading and Editing Over Writing**: Vim emphasizes the ability to quickly navigate and manipulate existing text rather than just writing new text. This reflects the reality that developers often spend more time reading and modifying code than writing it from scratch.
- **Modal Editor**: Vim operates in different modes, primarily Normal mode and Insert mode. This design allows for a vast array of shortcuts and commands for text manipulation without the need for multiple key combinations.
- **Programmable and Mouse-Free**: Vim can be customized and extended using its scripting language. It is optimized for keyboard use, minimizing reliance on the mouse, which speeds up editing tasks.

# Modal Editing in Vim

## Different Operating Modes

Vim's efficiency comes from its use of modes, each serving a specific purpose:

- **Normal Mode**: The default mode for navigation and executing commands to manipulate text. In this mode, keys correspond to actions rather than characters.
- **Insert Mode**: Used for inserting new text into the document. In this mode, the keyboard behaves like a traditional text editor.
- **Other Modes**:

    - **Replace Mode**: Allows you to overwrite existing text.
    - **Visual Mode**: Enables text selection for operations like copying or deleting.
    - **Command-line Mode**: Accessed by pressing `:`, used for executing commands like saving or quitting.

---

## Mode Switching

Understanding how to switch between modes is essential:
- **Switch to Normal Mode**: Press `<ESC>` at any time to return to Normal mode from any other mode.
- **Enter Insert Mode**: Press `i` to start inserting text before the cursor position.
- **Enter Replace Mode**: Press `R` to begin overwriting text from the cursor position.
- **Enter Visual Modes**:
    - **Character-wise Visual Mode**: Press `v`.
    - **Line-wise Visual Mode**: Press `V`.
    - **Block Visual Mode**: Press `<C-v>` (Ctrl + v).
- **Enter Command-line Mode**: Press `:` to execute commands.

These mode switches allow you to perform a wide range of operations efficiently.

## Inserting Text

To insert text in Vim:
- **Enter Insert Mode**: From Normal mode, press `i` to begin inserting text at the cursor's current position.
- **Return to Normal Mode**: Press `<ESC>` to exit Insert mode and return to Normal mode, where you can navigate and execute commands.

---

## Buffers, Tabs, and Windows

Vim manages files and views using:

- **Buffers**: In-memory versions of opened files. Each file you edit is stored in a buffer.
- **Windows**: Viewports into buffers. You can split your screen to view multiple buffers or different parts of the same buffer.
- **Tabs**: Collections of windows. Tabs can contain multiple windows, allowing you to organize your workspace.

Understanding how to use buffers, windows, and tabs helps in managing multiple files and views effectively.

---

## Command-line Mode

Command-line mode allows you to execute more complex commands:

- **Entering Command-line Mode**: Press `:` from Normal mode.
- **Common Commands**:
    - **Save File**: `:w` writes the current buffer to disk.
    - **Quit Vim**: `:q` exits Vim. Use `:q!` to force quit without saving changes.
    - **Save and Quit**: `:wq` or `:x` saves changes and exits.

Using command-line mode gives you access to a wide range of powerful Vim commands.

## Movement Commands

Efficient navigation is a key advantage of Vim:

- **Basic Movements**:
    - `h`: Move left.
    - `j`: Move down.
    - `k`: Move up.
    - `l`: Move right.
- **Word Movements**:
    - `w`: Move to the beginning of the next word.
    - `b`: Move to the beginning of the previous word.
    - `e`: Move to the end of the current word.
- **Line Movements**:
    - `0`: Move to the beginning of the line.
    - `$`: Move to the end of the line.
- **Screen Movements**:
    - `Ctrl + f`: Move forward one screen.
    - `Ctrl + b`: Move backward one screen.
- **File Movements**:
    - `gg`: Go to the first line of the file.
    - `G`: Go to the last line of the file.
    - `:<line number>`: Go to a specific line number.
- **Search Movements**:
    - `/pattern`: Search forward for a pattern.
    - `?pattern`: Search backward for a pattern.
    - `n`: Repeat the search in the same direction.
    - `N`: Repeat the search in the opposite direction.

## Selection in Visual Modes

Visual modes enable you to select text for editing:

- **Visual Mode (`v`)**: Select text character by character.
- **Visual Line Mode (`V`)**: Select entire lines.
- **Visual Block Mode (`Ctrl + v`)**: Select columns of text, useful for editing multiple lines simultaneously.

Once you've made a selection, you can perform operations like deleting,
yanking (copying), or changing the selected text.

---

## Editing Commands

Vim provides powerful commands for manipulating text:

- **Delete Commands**:
    - `d{motion}`: Delete text that is specified by the motion command.
        - Example: `dw` deletes from the cursor to the end of the word.
        - Example: `dd` deletes the entire current line.
- **Change Commands**:
    - `c{motion}`: Change text specified by the motion command (deletes and enters Insert mode).
        - Example: `cw` changes the word from the cursor onward.
- **Other Commands**:
    - `x`: Delete the character under the cursor.
    - `s`: Delete the character under the cursor and enter Insert mode.
    - `u`: Undo the last action.
    - `Ctrl + r`: Redo the undone action.
    - `y`: Yank (copy) text specified by a motion.
        - Example: `yy` yanks the entire line.
    - `p`: Paste the yanked or deleted text after the cursor.

---

## Counts and Modifiers

You can modify commands with counts and use text objects for more precise editing:

- **Counts**:
    - Precede a command with a number to repeat it.
        - Example: `3w` moves forward three words.
        - Example: `5j` moves down five lines.
- **Modifiers**:
    - **`i` (inner)**: Targets the inside of a text object.
    - **`a` (around)**: Targets the text object including its surrounding characters (like parentheses or quotes).
- **Examples**:
    - `ciw`: Change inner word (replace the word under the cursor).
    - `di(`: Delete inside the parentheses.
    - `da"`: Delete around double quotes, including the quotes themselves.

        - Example: `:%s/old/new/g` replaces all occurrences of "old" with "new" in the entire file.
    - Supports regular expressions for powerful pattern matching.
- **Multiple Windows**:
    - Split the window horizontally with `:split` or `Ctrl + w s`.
    - Split vertically with `:vsplit` or `Ctrl + w v`.
    - Navigate between windows using `Ctrl + w` followed by an arrow key or `h`, `j`, `k`, `l`.
- **Macros**:
    - Record repetitive actions:
        - Start recording with `q` followed by a register (e.g., `qa`).
        - Perform the desired actions.
        - Stop recording with `q`.
        - Replay the macro with `@` followed by the register (`@a`).
        - Repeat the macro multiple times with a count (e.g., `10@a`).
