# Basics of Bash Scripting

**Bash scripting** allows you to automate tasks by writing sequences of commands in a file, known as a script.
- **Execution of Commands**: Scripts can run [any command you can type in the terminal](courses/missing_semester/2024-10-05-1#using-the-shell).
- **Control Flow Expressions**: Utilize `if`, `for`, `while`, and other control structures to make decisions.
- **Tailored for Shell Tasks**: Ideal for automating command-line tasks, file manipulation, and system administration.

## Variables and Strings in Bash

In Bash scripting, you can assign values to variables and use them throughout your script.

- **Assigning Variables**: Use the syntax `variable_name=value` without spaces around the `=`.

  ```bash
  foo=bar
  ```

- **Accessing Variables**: Prefix the variable name with `$` to access its value.

  ```bash
  echo "$foo"  # Outputs: bar
  ```

- **Quoting Strings**:
    - **Double Quotes (`"`)**: Variables inside double quotes are expanded (their values are used).
    - **Single Quotes (`'`)}**: Variables inside single quotes are treated as literal strings (no expansion).

  Example:

  ```bash
  echo "$foo"  # Prints the value of foo, which is 'bar'
  echo '$foo'  # Prints the string '$foo' literally
  ```

---

## Special Variables in Bash

Bash provides several special variables that give you information about your script and the environment:

- **`$0`**: The name of the script itself.
- **`$1` to `$9`**: The first nine arguments passed to the script. `$1` is the first argument, `$2` is the second, and so on.
- **`$@`**: All the arguments passed to the script as an array.
- **`$#`**: The number of arguments passed to the script.
- **`$?`**: The return code (exit status) of the last executed command. A value of `0` typically means success.
- **`$$`**: The process ID (PID) of the current script.
- **`!!`**: The entire last command executed in the shell, including arguments. Useful for repeating commands, especially with `sudo`:

  ```bash
  sudo !!
  ```

- **`$_`**: The last argument of the previous command. In interactive shells, you can also retrieve this by pressing `Esc` followed by `.` or `Alt + .`.

> [!TIP]
> As noted, `$9` is the highest numbered positional parameter. To access more than nine arguments, use `${10}`, `${11}`, and so on until `${ARG_MAX}`

For a comprehensive list of special characters and variables in Bash,
refer to [Special Characters in Bash](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/special-chars.html).

---

## Command Execution and Return Codes

Understanding how commands execute and return codes is essential in Bash scripting.

- **Conditional Execution**:
    - **`&&`**: Executes the next command only if the previous command succeeded (returned exit status `0`).
    - **`||`**: Executes the next command only if the previous command failed (non-zero exit status).
    - **`;`**: Executes commands sequentially, regardless of the exit status of previous commands.
- **`true` and `false` Commands**:
    - **`true`**: A command that does nothing and returns a success exit status (`0`).
    - **`false`**: A command that does nothing and returns a failure exit status (`1`).

Example:

```bash
false || echo "Oops, fail"
# Output: Oops, fail

true || echo "Will not be printed"
# No output, since 'true' succeeded

true && echo "Things went well"
# Output: Things went well

false && echo "Will not be printed"
# No output, since 'false' failed

true ; echo "This will always run"
# Output:
# This will always run

false ; echo "This will always run"
# Output:
# This will always run
```

## Permissions – Brief Recap

Unix-like operating systems use a permission system to control access to files and directories.

**Permission Types**:

1. **Read (r)**:
    - Files: Allows viewing the contents of a file.
    - Directories: Allows listing the contents within the directory.

2. **Write (w)**:
    - Files: Allows modifying or deleting the file's contents.
    - Directories: Allows adding, removing, or renaming files within the directory.

3. **Execute (x)**:
    - Files: Allows executing the file as a program or script.
    - Directories: Allows accessing or traversing into the directory.

**User Categories**:
- **User (u)**: The owner of the file or directory.
- **Group (g)**: Users who are part of the file's group.
- **Other (o)**: All other users not covered by user or group.

Permissions are often represented in the format `rwxrwxrwx`, where each set of `rwx` corresponds to user, group, and other.

> [!TIP]
> `r = 4`, `w = 2`, `x = 1` in case you need to set permissions numerically. 

---

## Default permissions

When a new file is created in Unix, it typically has the following default permissions:

- **User (Owner)**: Read and Write (`rw-`)
- **Group**: Read-only (`r--`)
- **Other**: Read-only (`r--`)

This is depicted as:

```
rw-r--r--
```

These defaults can be modified using the `umask` command, which sets default permission masks.

---

## Script Example

Below is an example of a Bash script that demonstrates variable usage, command substitution, and control flow.

> [!NOTE]
> It's recommended to use `[[ ]]` for conditional expressions as they are more robust than `[ ]`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Starting program at $(date)" # Outputs the current date and time

echo "Running program $0 with $# arguments with pid $$"

for file in "$@"; do
    grep foobar "$file" > /dev/null 2> /dev/null
    # The 'grep' command searches for 'foobar' in the file.
    # Output is redirected to '/dev/null' to suppress it.
    # STDOUT and STDERR are redirected since we don't need them.

    if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
        # If 'grep' did not find 'foobar' (exit status not equal to 0)
        echo "File $file does not have any 'foobar', adding one"
        echo "# foobar" >> "$file"
        # Appends '# foobar' to the file
    fi
done
```

---

## Command Substitution Using `$( CMD )`

Command substitution allows you to capture the output of a command and use it within another command.

Example in a [Dockerfile](courses/missing_semester/2024-11-02-6#dockerfile):

```dockerfile
GNUPGHOME="$(mktemp -d)" && \
export GNUPGHOME && \
for key in \
    "B46DC71E03FEEB7F89D1F2491F7A8F87B9D8F501" \
  ; do \
    gpg --batch --keyserver "keyserver.ubuntu.com" --recv-keys "$key" ; \
done && \
gpg --verify "/tmp/$QD_NAME.tar.gz.sha256.asc" "/tmp/$QD_NAME.tar.gz.sha256" && \
(cd /tmp && sha256sum --check --status "$QD_NAME.tar.gz.sha256") && \
```

- **`GNUPGHOME="$(mktemp -d)"`**: Creates a temporary directory and assigns it to `GNUPGHOME`.
- **`gpg --recv-keys "$key"`**: Imports a GPG key.
- **Command substitution** is used to set environment variables or capture command outputs within scripts.

---

## Control Flow and Functions

Bash supports typical control flow structures:

- **Conditional Statements**: `if`, `else`, `elif`
- **Case Statements**: `case` for matching patterns
- **Loops**:
    - **`while`**: Repeats as long as a condition is true.
    - **`for`**: Iterates over a list of items.

### Function Example: Creating and Entering a Directory

You can define functions to encapsulate reusable code.

```bash
mcd () {           # Define a function named 'mcd'
    mkdir -p "$1"  # Create a directory and parent directories if they don't exist
    cd "$1"        # Change to the created directory
    # $1 is the first argument passed to the function
}
```

Usage:

```bash
mcd my_new_directory
```

This command will create `my_new_directory` and then change into it.

---

## Shell Functions vs. Scripts

Understanding the difference between functions and scripts is important:
- **Functions**:
    - Written in the shell's language.
    - Loaded into memory once when the shell starts or when the function is defined.
    - Can modify the shell's environment (e.g., change directories, set variables).
    - Promote code modularity, reuse, and clarity.
    - Typically included in your shell configuration files like `.bashrc`.
- **Scripts**:
    - It can be written in any scripting language (Bash, Python, Perl, etc.).
    - Executed as separate processes each time they are run.
    - Cannot modify the parent shell's environment directly (changes are limited to the script's process).
    - Useful for automating tasks and can be invoked from any shell.

In summary, 
- use functions for quick, shell-specific tasks that may need to interact with the shell environment. 
- use scripts for more complex tasks or when using different languages.

---

## Bash Comparisons and Globbing

**Comparisons**:

- Use `[[ ]]` for conditional expressions in Bash. It's more powerful and safer than `[ ]`.
  Examples:

  ```bash
  if [[ "$variable" -eq 10 ]]; then
      echo "Variable is equal to 10"
  fi
  ```

**Globbing**:

- **Wildcards** are used to match file names and patterns.
    - **`*`**: Matches any number of any characters (including none).
    - **`?`**: Matches exactly one character.
    - **`[ ]`**: Matches any one character inside the brackets.
    - **`{}`**: Brace expansion for generating arbitrary strings.

  Examples:

  ```bash
  ls *.txt           # Lists all files ending with '.txt'
  ls file?.txt       # Matches 'file1.txt', 'fileA.txt', etc.
  mv file{1,2}.txt   # Expands to 'mv file1.txt file2.txt'
  ```

Globbing is a powerful feature for working with multiple files and automating tasks.

# More Shell tools

## Discovering Command Usage

![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tar_2x.png)

When working with the shell, you might encounter unfamiliar commands or need to recall how to use a command.

**Resources**:

- **`--help`**: Most commands provide a quick help message.

  ```bash
  command --help
  ```

- **`man` Command**: Access the manual pages for detailed information.

  ```bash
  man rm
  ```

- **`tldr` Pages**: Simplified and community-driven man pages.

  ```bash
  tldr tar
  ```

  Install `tldr` with:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install tldr    # On Debian/Ubuntu
  brew install tldr        # On macOS with Homebrew
  ```

These tools help you quickly understand command usage and options.

## Finding Files

Searching for files in the file system is a common task.

**Tools**:

- **`find`**:

    - Searches for files in a directory hierarchy.
    - Syntax:

      ```bash
      find /path -name "filename"
      ```

    - Example:

      ```bash
      find /home/user -name "*.txt"
      ```

- **`fd`**:

    - A simpler and faster alternative to `find`.
    - Syntax:

      ```bash
      fd pattern [path]
      ```

    - Example:

      ```bash
      fd ".txt$" /home/user
      ```

- **`locate`**:

    - Searches a database of files for quick results.
    - Requires updating the database periodically with `updatedb`.
    - Example:

      ```bash
      locate myfile.txt
      ```

**Usage Scenarios**:

- Use **`find`** when you need complex search criteria or actions.
- Use **`fd`** for simpler and faster searches.
- Use **`locate`** when you need quick results and the database is up-to-date.

---

## Finding Code

Searching within files for specific patterns is essential for code and text analysis.

**Tools**:

- **`grep`**:
    - Searches for patterns in files.
    - Syntax:

      ```bash
      grep "pattern" file.txt
      ```
- **Alternatives**:
    - **`ack`**: Designed for programmers, faster than `grep`.
    - **`ag`** (The Silver Searcher): Very fast code searching tool.
    - **`rg`** (Ripgrep): Extremely fast search tool, respects `.gitignore` by default.

**Pattern Searching Examples**:

- Search recursively for a pattern in all `.py` files:

  ```bash
  grep -r --include="*.py" "def my_function" .
  ```

- Using `rg` for the same task:

  ```bash
  rg "def my_function" -t py
  ```

These tools help you find code snippets, functions, or any text within files quickly.

---

## Finding Shell Commands

Recall previous commands or search through your command history.

**Tools and Techniques**:

- **`history`** Command:

  ```bash
  history
  ```

- **Reverse Search with `Ctrl + R`**:

    - Press `Ctrl + R` and start typing to search backward through your history.

- **`fzf` (Fuzzy Finder)**:

    - An interactive command-line fuzzy finder.
    - Can be integrated with shell history for faster searching.
    - Installation:

      ```bash
      sudo apt install fzf    # On Debian/Ubuntu
      brew install fzf        # On macOS with Homebrew
      ```

    - Usage:

      ```bash
      history | fzf
      ```

**Autosuggestions**:

- **Fish Shell** or Zsh with plugins can provide command autosuggestions based on history.

**Protecting Sensitive Entries**:

- Be cautious with sensitive data in commands (like passwords).
- Avoid typing sensitive information directly; use input prompts or configuration files.

---

## Directory Navigation

Advanced tools can make navigating directories more efficient.

**Tools**:

- **`tree`**:

    - Displays directories and files in a tree-like format.
    - Usage:

      ```bash
      tree
      ```

- **`broot`**:
    - A modern, interactive tree command with fuzzy search.
    - Installation:

      ```bash
      brew install broot     # On macOS
      ```

- **`nnn`**:
    - A terminal-based file browser with minimalistic design.
    - Supports plugins for extended functionality.

- **`ranger`**:
    - A console file manager with VI key bindings.
    - Provides a preview of the selected file.

These tools enhance your ability to navigate and manage the file system from the command line.
