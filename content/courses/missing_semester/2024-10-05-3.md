## Introduction
- Understanding the use and mechanics of Version Control Systems (VCSs)
- Focus on Git, the de facto standard for version control

---

## What is Version Control?
- Tools to track changes in source code or file collections
- Maintains history, facilitates collaboration
- Uses snapshots to encapsulate the state of files and folders

---

## Why Use Version Control?
- Track changes, understand history
- Collaborate with others seamlessly
- Answer critical questions about code changes

---

## Git's Reputation
- Known for its complexity
- Emphasizing understanding over memorization of commands

# Git's Data Model

---

## Snapshots in Git
- Git views history as a series of snapshots (trees and blobs)
- Example tree structure:
  ```
  <root> (tree)
  |
  +- foo (tree)
  |  |
  |  + bar.txt (blob, contents = "hello world")
  |
  +- baz.txt (blob, contents = "git is wonderful")
  ```

---

## Modeling History
- History represented as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of snapshots
- Snapshots are commits with parent references
- Commits can have multiple parents (merging branches)

---

## Commit History Visualization
- Each commit points to its parent(s)
- Branches and merges in development are clearly visible

```
o <-- o <-- o <-- o
            ^
             \
              --- o <-- o
```

---

## Immutable Commits
- Commits are immutable in Git
- Edits create new commits; references are updated

---

## Data Model as Pseudocode
- Conceptual representation of Git's data model
```typescript
type blob = array<byte>
type tree = map<string, tree | blob>
type commit = struct
{
    parents: array<commit>
    author: string
    message: string
    snapshot: tree
}
```

---

## Objects and Content-Addressing
- Git stores objects (blobs, trees, commits) content-addressed by SHA-1 hash
- Objects refer to other objects via hash

---

## References
- Human-readable names for SHA-1 hashes (e.g., `master`)
- References are mutable, unlike objects

---

## Repositories
- A repository is a collection of objects and references

---

# Staging Area

- Mechanism to specify modifications for the next snapshot
- Allows for clean, organized commits

---

## Git CLI Basics

- `git help <command>`: get help for a git command
- `git init`: creates a new git repo, with data stored in the `.git` directory
- `git status`: tells you what's going on
- `git add <filename>`: adds files to staging area
- `git commit`: creates a new commit
- `git log`: shows a flattened log of history
- `git log --all --graph --decorate`: visualizes history as a DAG
- `git diff <filename>`: show changes you made relative to the staging area
- `git diff <revision> <filename>`: shows differences in a file between snapshots
- `git checkout <revision>`: updates HEAD and current branch

---

- Write [good commit messages](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)!
- Even more reasons to write [it's helpful](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)!

---

## Branching and Merging
- `git branch`: shows branches
- `git branch <name>`: creates a branch
- `git checkout -b <name>`: creates a branch and switches to it
    - same as `git branch <name>; git checkout <name>`
- `git merge <revision>`: merges into current branch
- `git mergetool`: use a fancy tool to help resolve merge conflicts
- `git rebase`: rebase set of patches onto a new base

---

## Remotes
- `git remote`: list remotes
- `git remote add <name> <url>`: add a remote
- `git push <remote> <local branch>:<remote branch>`: send objects to remote, and update remote reference
- `git branch --set-upstream-to=<remote>/<remote branch>`: set up correspondence between local and remote branch
- `git fetch`: retrieve objects/references from a remote
- `git pull`: same as `git fetch; git merge`
- `git clone`: download repository from remote

---

## Undo
- `git commit --amend`: edit a commit's contents/message
- `git reset HEAD <file>`: unstage a file
- `git checkout -- <file>`: discard changes

---

# Advanced Git

- `git config`: Git is [highly customizable](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config)
- `git clone --depth=1`: shallow clone, without entire version history
- `git add -p`: interactive staging
- `git rebase -i`: interactive rebasing
- `git blame`: show who last edited which line
- `git stash`: temporarily remove modifications to working directory
- `git bisect`: binary search history (e.g. for regressions)
- `.gitignore`: [specify](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) intentionally untracked files to ignore

---

## Miscellaneous

- GUI clients, shell and editor integration
- Different workflows (e.g., GitFlow, pull requests)
- GitHub and other Git hosting providers
