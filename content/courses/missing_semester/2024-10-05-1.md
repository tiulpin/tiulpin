## What's the shell?

- Multiple interfaces exist: GUIs, voice interfaces, AR/VR.
- Graphical interfaces are limited.
- For full control, use a textual interface: The Shell.
- Platforms offer a variety of shells.
- Introduction to "bash" (Bourne Again SHell).

---

## Accessing the Shell

- To start: you need a _terminal_.
- A shell _prompt_ is where you type commands.

```bash
# missing:$ ··································· bash

```

---

## Using the shell

- Typing a command at the prompt will execute it.
- Arguments can be passed to commands.

```bash
# missing:$ ··································· bash
date
```

---

## More Shell Commands

- Commands are parsed by whitespace.
- `$PATH` helps find executable programs.

```bash
# missing:$ ··································· bash
echo hello
# we expect hello
```

---

## Navigating in the shell

- Understanding paths.
- `pwd` shows the current directory.
- `cd` changes directories.
- Use `ls` to list contents.

---

## Shell Permissions

```bash
# missing:$ ··································· bash
ls -l ~
```

- Using `mv`, `cp`, `mkdir`.
- The `man` command for manuals.

---

## Connecting programs

- Programs have input and output streams.
- Redirection with `< file` and `> file`.
- Using pipes `|` to chain commands.

---

## More about Programs and Pipes

```bash
# missing:$ ··································· bash
ls -l / | tail -n1
```

- Use of `curl`, `grep`, and `cut`.

---

## A versatile and powerful tool

- Understanding the "root" user.
- The use of `sudo` for superuser actions.
- Kernel parameters in `sysfs`.

---

## A small break...

---

# Job Control

---

## Interrupting a Job
- Need to stop lengthy commands, like a `find` command in large directories.
- Common way: `Ctrl-C`.
- How and why does this work?

---

## Killing a process
- Shell communicates via _signals_.
- Signals act as _software interrupts_.
- `Ctrl-C` sends a `SIGINT` signal to the process.

---

A Python script that captures `SIGINT` and ignores it.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import signal, time

def handler(signum, time):
    print("\nI got a SIGINT, but I am not stopping")

signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, handler)
i = 0
while True:
    time.sleep(.1)
    print("\r{}".format(i), end="")
    i += 1
```

---

- Sending `SIGINT` to above program will not stop it.
- `SIGQUIT` (by typing `Ctrl-\`) can be used instead.

```
$ python sigint.py
24^C
I got a SIGINT, but I am not stopping
26^C
I got a SIGINT, but I am not stopping
30^\[1]    39913 quit       python sigint.py
```

---

## Additional Signals
- `SIGINT` and `SIGQUIT`: Terminal related.
- `SIGTERM`: Generic signal for graceful exit.
- Use `kill -TERM <PID>` to send `SIGTERM`.

---

## Pausing and Backgrounding Processes
- `SIGSTOP` pauses a process.
- `Ctrl-Z` sends `SIGTSTP`, a terminal version of `SIGSTOP`.
- Continue with `fg` (foreground) or `bg` (background).
- Check jobs with `jobs` command.

---

## Example Session

```
$ sleep 1000
^Z
[1]  + 18653 suspended  sleep 1000
$ nohup sleep 2000 &
...
$ jobs
...
$ kill -STOP %1
...
$ kill -SIGHUP %1
...
```

---

## Signals to Remember
- `SIGKILL`: Can't be captured, always terminates the process.
- More signals: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(IPC)
- Check signals with `man signal` or `kill -l`.

---

# Terminal Multiplexers

---

## Introduction
- Want multiple terminal sessions? Use terminal multiplexers.
- Examples: `tmux` and `screen`.
- Run side-by-side sessions, detach and reattach later.

---

## Using `tmux`
- Keybindings form: `<C-b> x`.
- Sessions, Windows, and Panes.
- Detailed commands and hierarchy explained.

---

# Aliases

---

## Introduction
- Shortcuts for long commands or common flags.
- Structure: `alias alias_name="command_to_alias arg1 arg2"`

---

## Alias Examples

```bash
alias ll="ls -lh"
alias gs="git status"
alias v="vim"
alias sl=ls
alias mv="mv -i"
...
```

---

## Aliases Persistence
- Aliases do not persist by default.
- Add to startup files like `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`.

---

# Dotfiles

---

## Introduction
- Plain-text configuration files.
- Examples: `.vimrc`, `.bashrc`.
- Shell, `git`, `vim`, `ssh`, and `tmux` are configured using dotfiles.

---

## Organizing Dotfiles
- Keep in a separate folder.
- Use version control.
- Symlink them using a script.

---

## Benefits of Organizing Dotfiles
- Easy installation on new machines.
- Portability across systems.
- Synchronization between machines.

---

## Further Reading
- Detailed resources for shell startup scripts, `tmux`, and `screen`.
- Explore and customize your toolset!

---

## Portability

A common pain with dotfiles is the configurations might not work across machines. Especially if they have different operating systems or shells.

---

Sometimes configurations should only apply to a specific machine. There are tricks to make this easier:

1. Use if-statements for machine-specific customizations.
2. Use includes for machine-specific settings.
3. Share configurations across programs.

---

```bash
if [[ "$(uname)" == "Linux" ]]; then {do_something}; fi
if [[ "$SHELL" == "zsh" ]]; then {do_something}; fi
if [[ "$(hostname)" == "myServer" ]]; then {do_something}; fi
```

---

In a `~/.gitconfig`:

```
[include]
    path = ~/.gitconfig_local
```

And `~/.gitconfig_local` can have machine-specific settings.

---

For sharing configurations, such as aliases:

```bash
if [ -f ~/.aliases ]; then
    source ~/.aliases
fi
```

---

A small break...

## Remote Machines

Remote servers are becoming more common in a programmer's workflow. SSH is the tool to know.



To SSH into a server:

```bash
ssh foo@bar.mit.edu
```

SSH can also run commands directly:

```bash
ssh foobar@server ls
```

---

## SSH Keys

Key-based authentication uses public-key cryptography. The private key (`~/.ssh/id_rsa` or `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`) is your password.

---

### Key Generation

Use `ssh-keygen` to generate a key pair:

```bash
ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

Choose a passphrase for security.

---

### Key Based Authentication

SSH checks `.ssh/authorized_keys`. To copy a public key:

```bash
cat .ssh/id_ed25519.pub | ssh foobar@remote 'cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'
```

Or use `ssh-copy-id`:

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/id_ed25519 foobar@remote
```

---

## Copying Files Over SSH

- Use `ssh+tee` for simple copies.
- Use `scp` for bulk copying.
- Use `rsync` for efficient copying.

---

## Port Forwarding

Link local ports to remote ones. Two types:

1. Local Port Forwarding
2. Remote Port Forwarding

---

**Local Port Forwarding**

---

**Remote Port Forwarding**
![Remote Port Forwarding](https://i.stack.imgur.com/4iK3b.png)

---

Example of local port forwarding:

```bash
ssh -L 9999:localhost:8888 foobar@remote_server
```

Navigate to `localhost:9999` on your local machine.

---

## SSH Configuration

Instead of using shell aliases:

```bash
alias my_server="ssh -i ~/.id_ed25519 --port 2222 -L 9999:localhost:8888 foobar@remote_server"
```

---

Use `~/.ssh/config`:

```bash
Host vm
    User foobar
    HostName 172.16.174.141
    Port 2222
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    LocalForward 9999 localhost:8888
```

---

## Miscellaneous

Consider [Mosh](https://mosh.org/) for roaming connections and [sshfs](https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs) to mount remote folders.


## Shells & Frameworks

While `bash` is popular, there are alternatives like `zsh` with enhanced features:

- Smarter globbing
- Spelling correction
- Better tab completion

---

**Frameworks** improve shells:

- [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)
- [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
- [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)
- [zsh-history-substring-search](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search)

## Terminal Emulators

Choosing a terminal emulator is vital. Consider:

* Font
* Color Scheme
* Shortcuts
* Tabs/Panes
* Scrollback
