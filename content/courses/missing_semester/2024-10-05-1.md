# Introduction

## What's the shell?

Multiple interfaces exist for interacting with computers, such as Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs),
voice interfaces, and Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) interfaces.

While graphical interfaces are user-friendly, they can be limited in terms of control and automation.
For full control over your computer, you can use a textual interface called the **shell**.

![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/is_it_worth_the_time_2x.png)

The shell allows you to type commands that the computer executes,
giving you powerful capabilities to manage files, run programs, and automate tasks.

Different operating systems offer a variety of shells.
One of the most common is **bash** (Bourne Again SHell), which is widely used on Unix-like systems.

---

## Prompt 

To start using the shell, you need a program called [a **terminal** or **terminal emulator**](courses/missing_semester/2024-10-05-1#terminal-emulators).
The terminal provides a window where you can interact with the shell.

When you open a terminal, you'll see a **shell prompt**, which is where you type your commands.
It often shows information like your username and current directory.

Here's an example of a shell prompt:

```bash
# missing:$ ··································· bash
```

This prompt indicates that the shell is ready to accept your commands.

---

## Using the shell

Typing a command at the prompt and pressing **Enter** will execute that command.

You can also pass **arguments** to commands to modify their behavior or provide input data.

For example, typing the `date` command displays the current date and time:

```bash
# missing:$ ··································· bash
date
```

After running this command, the shell might output:

```
Mon Oct  5 14:23:45 UTC 2024
```

---

## More Shell Commands

Commands are parsed by the shell using whitespace (spaces and tabs) to separate the command and its arguments.

For example:

```bash
# missing:$ ··································· bash
echo hello
```

The `echo` command prints the arguments you provide. In this case, it will display:

```
hello
```

### Shell paths
The shell uses the `$PATH` environment variable to locate executable programs.

`$PATH` is a list of directories that the shell searches when you enter a command.

```bash
# missing:$ ··································· bash
echo $PATH
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
```

---

## Navigating in the shell

Understanding how to navigate the file system is crucial.

- **`pwd`**: Displays the current working directory.

  ```bash
  pwd
  ```

- **`cd`**: Changes the current directory.

  ```bash
  cd /path/to/directory
  ```
- **`cd -`**: Switches to the previous directory.

- **`ls`**: Lists the contents of a directory.

  ```bash
  ls
  ```

Using these commands, you can move around the file system and see what files and folders are available.

---

## Shell Permissions

[File permissions](courses/missing_semester/2024-10-05-2#permissions--brief-recap) determine who can read, write, or execute a file.

You can view permissions using:

```bash
# missing:$ ··································· bash
ls -l ~
```

The `-l` option tells `ls` to use the long listing format,
which includes permissions, ownership, size, and modification date.

Common file management commands include:

- **`mv`**: Moves or renames files.

  ```bash
  mv source_file destination_file
  ```

- **`cp`**: Copies files.

  ```bash
  cp source_file destination_file
  ```

- **`mkdir`**: Creates new directories.

  ```bash
  mkdir new_directory
  ```

To learn more about any command, use the `man` command to access the manual pages. For example:

```bash
man ls
```

---

## Connecting programs

Programs can be connected using input and output streams.

- **Redirection**: You can redirect the output of a command to a file or use a file as input.

    - **Output Redirection**: `>` writes output to a file (overwrites if the file exists).

      ```bash
      echo "Hello, World!" > hello.txt
      ```

    - **Input Redirection**: `<` takes input from a file.

      ```bash
      sort < unsorted_list.txt
      ```

- **Pipes**: The `|` symbol passes the output of one command as input to another.

  ```bash
  ls -l | grep "^d"
  ```

  This command lists all items and then filters to show only directories.

Such connections allow you to chain commands together to perform complex tasks, and you can set up automated [scripts](courses/missing_semester/2024-10-05-2).

---

## More about Programs and Pipes

You can combine commands to perform complex tasks.

For example:

- **`curl`**: Transfers data from or to a server.

  ```bash
  curl http://example.com
  ```

- **`grep`**: Searches for patterns in text.

  ```bash
  grep "search_term" file.txt
  ```

- **`cut`**: Removes sections from each line of files.

  ```bash
  cut -d',' -f1 file.csv
  ```

By combining these commands with pipes, you can manipulate and process data efficiently.

---

## A versatile and powerful tool

The shell gives you powerful control over your system.

> [!NOTE]
> To execute some commands, you may need administrative permissions (superuser).
>
> **Root User** is the superuser account with full permissions.
> Be cautious when using it.
> For executing commands as the superuser, you can use the `sudo` command (do as superuser).

This command would allow you to update the package list on Debian:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

Also, with superuser permissions, you are able to access **kernel parameters in `sysfs`**, like the CPU temperature:

```bash
cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp
```

Or you can change the brightness of your Linux-based Intel laptop screen:
```bash
echo 1000 | sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness
```

Always exercise caution when performing administrative tasks to avoid unintended consequences.

---

# Job Control

## Interrupting a Job
Sometimes, you might run a command that takes longer than expected, like searching through large directories with `find`.

To stop a running command, you can use **Ctrl-C**, which sends an interrupt signal to the process.

But how does this work?

---

## Killing a process

The shell communicates with processes using **signals**, which are notifications sent to processes to trigger predefined behaviors.

When you press **Ctrl-C**, it sends a `SIGINT` (Signal Interrupt) to the process, which usually tells it to terminate.

---

A Python script that captures `SIGINT` and ignores it.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# btw, a previous line is a Shebang line - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)
import signal, time

def handler(signum, time):
    print("\nI got a SIGINT, but I am not stopping")

signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, handler)
i = 0
while True:
    time.sleep(.1)
    print("\r{}".format(i), end="")
    i += 1
```

This script increments a counter and prints it continuously.
It defines a handler for `SIGINT` that prevents the script from stopping when **Ctrl-C** is pressed.

---

When you run this script and press **Ctrl-C**, you'll see:

```
$ python sigint.py
24^C
I got a SIGINT, but I am not stopping
26^C
I got a SIGINT, but I am not stopping
```

Since the script ignores `SIGINT`, you can use **Ctrl-\\** to send a `SIGQUIT` signal, which forces the script to quit.

```
30^\[1]    39913 quit       python sigint.py
```

---

## Additional Signals

- **`SIGINT`**: Interrupt signal (sent by **Ctrl-C**).
- **`SIGQUIT`**: Quit signal (sent by **Ctrl-\\**).
- **`SIGTERM`**: Termination signal for graceful shutdown.

To send a `SIGTERM` to a process:

```bash
kill -TERM PID  # where PID is the process ID
```

Signals allow you to manage processes beyond simple starting and stopping.

---

## Pausing and Backgrounding Processes
- **`SIGSTOP`**: Stops (pauses) a process.
- **`SIGTSTP`**: Terminal stop signal (sent by **Ctrl-Z**).

When you press **Ctrl-Z**, the shell stops the running process and returns control to you.

You can then:

- **Foreground (`fg`)**: Resume the process in the foreground.
- **Background (`bg`)**: Continue the process in the background.

List all jobs with:

```bash
jobs
```

---

## Example Session

```
$ sleep 1000
^Z
[1]  + 18653 suspended  sleep 1000
$ nohup sleep 2000 &
...
$ jobs
...
$ kill -STOP %1
...
$ kill -SIGHUP %1
...
```

In this example:

- **`sleep 1000`** runs a command that sleeps for 1000 seconds.
- **Ctrl-Z** stops the process.
- **`nohup`** runs a command immune to hangups.
- **`jobs`** lists current jobs.
- **`kill -STOP %1`** stops job number 1.
- **`kill -SIGHUP %1`** sends a hangup signal to job number 1.

---

## Signals to Remember
- **`SIGKILL`** (`kill -9`): Forcefully terminates a process and cannot be caught or ignored.

```bash
kill -KILL <PID>
```

- For a list of signals, you can use:

```bash
kill -l
```

- More information about signals: [Wikipedia - Signal (IPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(IPC))

Understanding signals helps you manage processes effectively.

# Terminal Multiplexers

## Introduction

Terminal multiplexers allow you to manage multiple terminal sessions within a single window.

Benefits include:

- Running multiple sessions simultaneously.
- Splitting the terminal into multiple panes.
- Detaching and reattaching sessions, keeping processes running even if you disconnect.

Popular terminal multiplexers:

- **`tmux`**
- **`screen`**

---

## Using `tmux`

`tmux` is a powerful tool for managing terminal sessions.

Key concepts:

- **Sessions**: Independent workspaces that can be detached and reattached.
- **Windows**: Like tabs within a session.
- **Panes**: Splits within a window, allowing multiple views.

Default keybindings use a prefix (usually **Ctrl-b**), followed by a command.

Examples:

- **`Ctrl-b c`**: Create a new window.
- **`Ctrl-b "`**: Split the current pane horizontally.
- **`Ctrl-b %`**: Split the current pane vertically.
- **`Ctrl-b d`**: Detach from the current session.

`tmux` enhances productivity by keeping your environment organized and persistent.

---

# Aliases

Aliases let you create shortcuts for commands, saving time and reducing errors.

The basic format is:

```bash
alias alias_name="command_to_alias arguments"
```

---

## Alias Examples

Common aliases include:

```bash
alias ll="ls -lh"           # Detailed list with human-readable sizes.
alias gs="git status"       # Shortcut for 'git status'.
alias v="vim"               # Shortens 'vim' to 'v'.
alias sl="ls"               # Corrects common typo.
alias mv="mv -i"            # Prompts before overwriting files.
```

These can be tailored to your workflow to increase efficiency.

---

## Aliases Persistence

Aliases are temporary unless saved in a startup file.

To make aliases permanent, add them to:

- **Bash**: `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_aliases`
- **Zsh**: `~/.zshrc`

For example, add to `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
alias ll="ls -lh"
alias gs="git status"
```

Then reload the configuration:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

---

# Dotfiles

**Dotfiles** are configuration files for your shell and other programs, usually starting with a dot (`.`).

Examples include:

- **`.bashrc`**: Configuration for Bash.
- **`.vimrc`**: Settings for Vim.
- **`.gitconfig`**: Configuration for Git.
- **`.ssh/config`**: SSH client settings.

Customizing dotfiles allows you to personalize your environment.

---

## Organizing Dotfiles
To manage your dotfiles:

1. **Create a dedicated directory** (e.g., `~/dotfiles`).

2. **Use version control** (like Git) to track changes.

   ```bash
   cd ~/dotfiles
   git init
   ```

3. **Symlink dotfiles** to their appropriate locations.

   ```bash
   ln -s ~/dotfiles/.bashrc ~/.bashrc
   ```

---

## Benefits of Organizing Dotfiles
- **Easy setup on new machines**: Clone your repository and create symlinks.

- **Consistency**: Maintain the same environment across multiple systems.

- **Backup and versioning**: Keep a history of changes and restore previous configurations if needed.

Organizing dotfiles streamlines your workflow and setup process.

---

## Portability

A common pain with dotfiles is the configurations might not work across machines. Especially if they have different operating systems or shells.

Sometimes configurations should only apply to a specific machine. There are tricks to make this easier:

1. Use [if-statements](courses/missing_semester/2024-10-05-2#bash-comparisons-and-globbing) for machine-specific customizations.
2. Use includes for machine-specific settings.
3. Share configurations across programs.

```bash
if [[ "$(uname)" == "Linux" ]]; then {do_something}; fi
if [[ "$SHELL" == "zsh" ]]; then {do_something}; fi
if [[ "$(hostname)" == "myServer" ]]; then {do_something}; fi
```

In a `~/.gitconfig`:

```
[include]
    path = ~/.gitconfig_local
```

And `~/.gitconfig_local` can have machine-specific settings.

For sharing configurations, such as aliases:

```bash
if [ -f ~/.aliases ]; then
    source ~/.aliases
fi
```

### Further Reading
To deepen your understanding:

- **Shell Startup Scripts**: Learn how shells initialize and read configuration files.
- **Community Dotfiles**: Check out other developers' dotfiles on platforms like GitHub for inspiration.

> [!TIP]
> Here are [my own personal dotfiles](https://github.com/tiulpin/tiulpin) that I use on macOS laptop.

Customizing your environment can **significantly** enhance productivity.

# Remote Machines

Accessing remote servers is common in development and operations.

To connect to a remote server using SSH:

```bash
ssh username@remote_server
```

You can also execute a command directly:

```bash
ssh username@remote_server command
```

Example:

```bash
ssh foobar@server ls  # This runs `ls` on the remote server.
```

---

## SSH Keys

[SSH keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssh-keygen) provide secure, password-less authentication.

- **Private Key**: Stored securely on your local machine (e.g., `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`).
- **Public Key**: Shared with the remote server, added to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

---

### Key Generation

Generate a key pair using (a command from the official GitHub documentation):

```bash
ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

- **`-o`**: Use new OpenSSH private key format.
- **`-a 100`**: Use 100 rounds of key derivation.
- **`-t ed25519`**: Specify the key type.
- **`-f`**: Specify the output file.

Set a passphrase for added security.

---

### Key-Based Authentication

Copy your public key to the remote server:

1. **Using `ssh-copy-id`**:

   ```bash
   ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 username@remote_server
   ```

2. **Manually copying**:

   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | ssh username@remote_server 'mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'
   ```

Now you can log in without a password.

---

## Copying Files Over SSH

Transfer files securely using SSH:

- **Simple Copy**:

  ```bash
  cat localfile | ssh username@remote_server 'cat > remotefile'
  ```

- **Using `scp`**:

  ```bash
  scp localfile username@remote_server:/path/to/destination
  scp -r localdir username@remote_server:/path/to/destination
  ```

- **Using `rsync`**:

  ```bash
  rsync -avz localdir username@remote_server:/path/to/destination
  ```

`rsync` is efficient for syncing directories.

---

## Port Forwarding

SSH can forward ports between your local machine and a remote server.

### Types of Port Forwarding

1. **Local Port Forwarding**: Access remote services locally.

   ```bash
   ssh -L local_port:destination_host:destination_port username@remote_server
   ```

2. **Remote Port Forwarding**: Expose local services to the remote server.

   ```bash
   ssh -R remote_port:destination_host:destination_port username@remote_server
   ```

---

## SSH Configuration

Instead of lengthy commands or aliases, use SSH configuration files.

Edit `~/.ssh/config`:

```bash
Host my_server
    User foobar
    HostName remote_server
    Port 2222
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    LocalForward 9999 localhost:8888
```

Now connect with:

```bash
ssh my_server
```

---

## Miscellaneous

Enhance your remote working experience:
- **[Mosh](https://mosh.org/)**: A mobile shell that supports intermittent connectivity.
- **[sshfs](https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs)**: Mount remote directories locally over SSH.

---

# Shells & Frameworks & More

While Bash is standard, other shells like **Zsh** offer advanced features.

Advantages of `Zsh`:
- **Enhanced Globbing**: More powerful file matching patterns.
- **Spelling Correction**: Corrects minor typos.
- **Improved Completion**: More intelligent auto-completion.

Frameworks provide themes and plugins to extend shell functionality.

Popular options:
- **[Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)**: A community-driven framework with many plugins and themes.
- **[Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)**: A configuration framework for Zsh.

Useful plugins:
- **[zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)**: Highlights command syntax.
- **[zsh-history-substring-search](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search)**: Enhances history search.

These tools can make your command-line experience more efficient and enjoyable.

## Terminal Emulators

Choosing a terminal emulator is vital. Consider:

* Font
* Color Scheme
* Shortcuts
* Tabs/Panes
* Scrollback

> 🆕 [Warp](https://app.warp.dev/referral/2YKWL2). I've used it since 2021, and it's a game-changer.

Experiment with different terminal emulators to find one that suits your preferences and enhances your productivity.
