# Kubernetes – practical development intro

> [!NOTE]
> We skip the lecture this time :)

---

- **Kubernetes**: For orchestrating containerized apps.
- **Docker**: Great for managing a few containers.
- **Orchestration Needs**: For managing larger systems (100s or 1000+ containers).
- **What Kubernetes Offers**: Scheduling, load balancing, and distribution of containers.

---

## Why Orchestration

- **Container Limitations**: Good for small scale; struggles with large systems.
- **Benefits of Orchestration**:
    - Efficiently manage numerous containers.
    - Automates deployment, scaling and operations.

---

## Introduction to Kubernetes

- **Origin**: Developed from Google's Borg and Omega systems.
- **Naming**: Greek for "Helmsman", steering wheel logo.
- **Language**: Written in Go.
- **Purpose**: Built for handling large numbers of containers efficiently.

---

## Learning kubectl and Basic Concepts

- **kubectl**: A command-line tool for Kubernetes.
- **Cluster**: Consists of a Control ("master") and multiple Nodes.
- **Nodes**: Machines that run containerized applications.

---

Install minikube.

---

## First Kubernetes Application

- **Deploying an App**: Using `kubectl run` command.
- **Behind the Scenes**: Kubernetes schedules and runs the application on a suitable node.
- **Pods**: Smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, holding the containerized app.

---

## Interacting with the Kubernetes Cluster

- **Listing Nodes**: `kubectl get nodes`.
- **Running Applications**: Deploy using `kubectl run`.
- **Viewing Deployments**: `kubectl get deployments`.

---

## Pods and Container Interaction

- **Pod Information**: Retrieving pod details using `kubectl get pods`.
- **HTTP API Access**: Using `kubectl proxy` for API access.
- **Exploring Pods**: `curl` requests to pod endpoints.

---

```shell
kubectl get pods
kubectl proxy
curl http://localhost:8001/version
kubectl get deployments
```

---

## Concepts: Pods, Nodes, Services, Deployments

---

### Pods

- **Atomic Unit**: Smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.
- **Components**: Consists of one or more containers (e.g., Docker) and shared resources like storage and networking.
- **Characteristics**: Co-located, co-scheduled containers within a Pod.

---

### Nodes

- **Definition**: Worker machines (virtual or physical) in a Kubernetes cluster.
- **Components**: Contains Kubelet, Kube proxy, and a container runtime.
- **Functionality**: Managed by the Master, hosts multiple pods.

---

### Deployments

- **Purpose**: Provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.
- **Functionality**: A Deployment controller provides updated status information about the rollout, it will ensure the desired state matches the current state.
- **Rolling Updates**: Deployments support rolling updates to your application, allowing you to deploy a new version of your app with zero downtime.

---

- **Rollbacks**: If something goes wrong, Kubernetes provides the ability to rollback this change.
- **Scaling**: Deployments can help to scale your application horizontally with a declarative command, Kubernetes users don't need to manually create new Pods, but instead they declare the number of Pods they want and Deployments ensure that this number is always met.

---

```shell

kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl delete deployment nginx-deployment
```

---

### Services

- **Purpose**: Handles pod mortality; maintains app accessibility.
- **ReplicaSet**: Ensures pod replication for consistent application running.
- **Service Types**: ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, ExternalName.


---

```shell
kubectl create deployment kubernetes-first-app --image=gcr.io/google-samples/kubernetes-bootcamp:v1 --port=8080
kubectl expose deployment kubernetes-first-app --type="NodePort" --port=8080
kubectl get services
kubectl describe services/kubernetes-first-app
kubectl describe deployment
```

---

### Scaling

We can scale our deployment and see the new pods being used.

```shell
kubectl scale deployments/kubernetes-first-app --replicas=4
```

---

# What k8s is not

---

### Data Storage
- Does not manage data storage volumes directly
- Does not replace traditional data management systems

---

### Databases
- Not a database management solution
- Does not handle database installation, configuration, or management

---

### Secret Management
- Limited capabilities in secret management
- Does not replace dedicated secret management tools

---

### Networking and Load Balancing
- Does not replace dedicated load balancers and network configurators
- Limited control over low-level networking features

---

### Application-Level Services
- Not designed for managing application-level services like message queues
- Does not replace specialized middleware solutions
- Does not automate the writing of custom application logic
- Requires manual intervention for specific business needs

---

Deploying broken software in many containers doesn't make it any less broken.
