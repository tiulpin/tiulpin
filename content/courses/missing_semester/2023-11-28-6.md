## Security and Cryptography Overview
- Focus on security concepts relevant to tools like Git and SSH.
- Emphasis on practical cryptography concepts.
- Not a substitute for formal security training.

---

## Entropy: Measuring Randomness
- Entropy quantifies randomness, crucial for password strength.
- Measured in bits; higher values indicate stronger passwords.
- Example: `correcthorsebatterystaple` vs `Tr0ub4dor&3`

---

## Understanding Hash Functions
- Maps arbitrary data to fixed-size values.

```plaintext
hash(value: array<byte>) -> vector<byte, N>  (for some fixed N)
```

- Properties: 
  - Deterministic, 
  - non-invertible, 
  - collision-resistant.
- Example: SHA1, although no longer considered strong.

```bash
printf 'hello' | sha1sum
```

---

## Applications of Hash Functions
- Used in Git for content storage.
- Summarizes file contents; aids in data verification.
- Commitment schemes in secure communications.

---

## Key Derivation Functions (KDFs)
- Produce keys from passphrases for cryptographic use.
- Designed to be slow to resist brute-force attacks.
- Applications: 
  - Creating encryption keys
  - Storing login credentials.

```bash
passwd
```

---

## Symmetric Cryptography
- Uses a single key for both encryption and decryption.
- Keygen produces a random key for secure communication.
- Example: 
  - AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).

---

## Asymmetric Cryptography
- Involves a public and a private key.
- Public key for encryption, private key for decryption.
- Used in PGP email, private messaging, and software signing.

---

## Key Distribution Challenges
- Distributing public keys and associating them with identities.
- Methods vary: Signal's trust on first use, PGP's web of trust, Keybase's social proof.

---

## Practical Security Tools

---

### Password Managers
- Store high-entropy passwords securely.
- Examples: KeePassXC, pass, 1Password.

---

### Two-Factor Authentication
- Enhances security by requiring an additional authentication factor.

---

### Full Disk Encryption
- Protects data on stolen laptops.
- Tools: 
  - Linux: cryptsetup + LUKS, 
  - Windows: BitLocker, 
  - macOS: FileVault.

---

## Private Messaging Security
- Signal and Keybase use asymmetric encryption for privacy.
- Key exchange is crucial for secure communication.

---

## SSH: Secure Shell
- Asymmetric key pair generation with `ssh-keygen`.
- Private key encrypted, public key shared for server access.
- Uses challenge-response for identity verification.

---

## Conclusion and Additional Resources
- Cryptography is a cornerstone of modern digital security.
