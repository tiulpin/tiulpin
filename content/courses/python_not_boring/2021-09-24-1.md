Syntax 1

```python
def get_lectures_stream():
    return "youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ"

>>> get_lectures_stream()
"youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ"
```

What if I remove return?

---

Syntax 2

- **name:** number can't be the first symbol, but almost any unicode symbol can be used
- **return:** if none, then returns `None`

```python
def get_lectures_stream():
    "youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ"

>>> get_lectures_stream()
None
```

---

Syntax 3

```python
def get_lectures_stream() -> str:
    """Returns the last lecture stream."""
    return "youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ"
```

Functions are first-class objects in Python.
What does it mean?

---

### 1️⃣ What is First-Class object

- Created at runtime
- Assigned to a variable or element in a data structure
- Passed as an argument to a function
- Returned as the result of a function

Integers, strings, dictionaries,     and functions in Python

### 🚀 Function as an object

```python
>>> get_lectures_stream.__doc__
'Returns the last lecture stream.'
```

---

### 🚲 Let's create a function

---

Let's create a function    1

```python
def min(x, y):
    return x if x < y else y

>>> min(-5, 0)
-5
```

---

Let's create a function    2

```python
def min(x, y):
    return x if x < y else y

>>> min(x=-5, y=0)
-5
```

---

Let's create a function    3

```python
def min(x, y):
	return x if x < y else y

>>> min(x=-5, z=0)
# ???
```

---

Let's upgrade the function!

```python
>>> min(1, 2, 3)
1
>>> min({1, 2, 3})
1
>>> bounded_min(-42, 0, 42, low=0, high=255)
0
```

---

### 📦 Packing and unpacking

---

We did it!

```python
def min(*args):  # what's type(args)?
    res = float("inf")
    for arg in args:
        if arg < res:
            res = arg
    return res
```

---

```python
>>> min(-5, 12, 13)
-5
>>> min()  # how to require at least 1 arg?
inf
```

---

The solution

```python
def min(first, *args):
    res = first
	# ...
```

---

🧐 How to apply the function to a collection? (list, tuple, set)

---

The answer: unpacking

```python
>>> xs = {-5, 12, 13}
>>> min(*xs)
-5
>>> min(*[-5, 12, 13])
-5
>>> min(*(-5, 12, 13))
-5
```

---

Let's get back...

```python
>>> def bounded_min(first, *args, lo=float("-inf"), hi=float("inf")):
        res = hi
        for arg in (first, ) + args:  # what's the algorithmic complexity?
            if arg < res and lo < arg < hi:
                res = arg
        return max(res, lo)
...
>>> bounded_min(-5, 12, 13, lo=0, hi=255)
12
```

---

👀  What's wrong?

```python
>>> def unique(iterable, seen=set()):
        acc = []
        for item in iterable:
            if item not in seen:
                seen.add(item)
                acc.append(item)
        return acc
```

Hint: when do default values initialize?

---

```python
>>> xs = [1, 1, 2, 3]
>>> unique(xs)
[1, 2, 3]
>>> unique(xs)
[]
>>> unique.__defaults__
({1, 2, 3},)
```
How to solve it?

---

The solution

```python
>>> def unique(iterable, seen=None):
        seen = set(seen or []) # None – falsy.
        acc = []
        for item in iterable:
            if item not in seen:
                seen.add(item)
                acc.append(item)
        return acc
...
>>> xs = [1, 1, 2, 3]
>>> unique(xs)
[1, 2, 3]
>>> unique(xs)
[1, 2, 3]
```

---

🤔 How-to: require key argument

```python
>>> def flatten(xs, *, depth=None):
        pass
...
>>> flatten([1, [2], 3], 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: flatten() takes 1 positional argument [...]
```

---

```python
>>> def runner(cmd, **kwargs):
        if kwargs.get("verbose", True):
            print("Logging enabled")
...
>>> runner("mysqld", limit=42)
Logging enabled
>>> runner("mysqld", **{"verbose": False})
>>> options = {"verbose": False}
>>> runner("mysqld", **options)
```

---

🚀 Assignment (unpacking)

```python
>>> x, y, z = [1, 2, 3]
>>> x, y, z = {1, 2, 3} # ???
>>> x, y, z = "xyz"
>>> first, *rest = range(1, 5)
>>> first, rest
(1, [2, 3, 4])
>>> first, *rest, last = range(1, 5)
>>> last
4
>>> for a, *b in [range(4), range(2)]:
        print(b)
...
[1, 2, 3]
[1]
```

---

Let's look inside one time only

```python
>>> import dis
>>> dis.dis("first, *rest, last = ('a', 'b', 'c')")
0 LOAD_CONST 4 (('a', 'b', 'c'))
3 UNPACK_EX 257
6 STORE_NAME 0 (first)
9 STORE_NAME 1 (rest)
12 STORE_NAME 2 (last)
15 LOAD_CONST 3 (None)
18 RETURN_VALUE
>>> first, *rest, last = ['a', 'b', 'c'] # ???
```

---

### Functions wrap up

- basic syntax
- minimal example
- packing, unpacking


---

### 👁 Scopes

---

```python
>>> def wrapper():
        def identity(x):
            return x
        return identity
...
>>> f = wrapper()
>>> f(42)
42
```

---

LEGB Rule: **Local** → **Enclosing** → **Global** → **Built-in**
The search is done during execution, not definition.

```python
>>> min                 # builtin
<built-in function min>
>>> min = 42            # global
>>> def f(*args):
        min = 2
        def g():        # enclosing
            min = 4     # local
            print(min)
...
```

### 🤔 Is Python a functional programming language?

---

Guido van Rossum

> I have never considered Python to be heavily influenced by functional languages, no matter what people say or think. I was much more familiar with imperative languages such as C and Algol 68 and although I had made functions first-class objects, I didn’t view Python as a functional programming language.

---

We have    anonymous functions!

```python
>>> lambda arguments: expression
# which is ...
>>> def <lambda>(arguments):
        return expression
>>> lambda foo, *args, bar=None, **kwargs: 42
<function <lambda> at 0x100fb9730>
```

---

**map** applies the given function to every iterable (sequence element)

```python
>>> map(indentity, range(4))
<map object at 0x100fc4c88>
>>> list(map(identity, range(4)))
[0, 1, 2, 3]
>>> set(map(lambda x: x % 7, [1, 9, 16, -1, 2, 5]))
{1, 2, 5, 6}
>>> map(lambda s: s.strip(), open("./HBA1.txt"))
<map object at 0x100fc4cc0>
```

---

**filter** removes any element, which is not satisfying the given predicat

```python
>>> filter(lambda x: x % 2 != 0, range(10))
<filter object at 0x1011edfd0>
>>> list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 != 0, range(10)))
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
```

---

**zip** builds tuple sequence from elements of multiple sequences

```python
>>> list(zip("abc", range(3), [42j, 42j, 42j]))
[('a', 0, 42j), ('b', 1, 42j), ('c', 2, 42j)]
```

---

We have    sequence (list, dict, ...) generators

```python
>>> [x ** 2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 1]
[1, 9, 25, 49, 81]
```

is better than

```python
>>> list(map(lambda x: x ** 2,
         filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 1,
                range(10))))
[1, 9, 25, 49, 81]
```

---

Which can be nested

```python
>>> nested = [range(5), range(8, 10)]
>>> [x for xs in nested for x in xs] # flatten
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9]
```

---

Sets and dictionaries generators

```python
>>> {x % 7 for x in [1, 9, 16, -1, 2, 5]}
{1, 2, 5, 6}
>>> date = {"year": 2014, "month": "September", "day": ""}
>>> {k: v for k, v in date.items() if v}
{'month': 'September', 'year': 2014}
>>> {x: x ** 2 for x in range(4)}
{0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9}
```

### ❓ How to generate 2D array of zeros in Python?

---

### � PEP-8

---

Why? To improve readability. Basic rules:

- 4 spaces for indentation
- 79 symbols for a line of code 🤔
- variables_and_functions, CONSTANTS_YEAH, JustClasses
- think how it can be read

---

To check equality...

- for objects: `!=` and `==`
- for singletons: `is` and `is not`
- for booleans: use the bool itself, e.g. `if foo:`

---

Write like it's English

- `if not key in d` 🤢
- `if key not in` 🤗

---

And write docstrings!
