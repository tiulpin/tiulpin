Python is an interpreted, high-level, and universal programming language. It‚Äôs design philosophy emphasizes code readability and ease of implementation. According to the study The State of the Octoverse in 2020 Python overtook Java in popularity and came in second place in the top most used programming languages on GitHub. Python is used in products by companies such as:

- Google
- Facebook
- Spotify
- JetBrains

They say that Python can **only** be used as a tool for writing small scripts, prototyping machine learning models, and creating auto-tests. However, [this is not true](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/python-developers-survey-2020/), and the goal of the course is to show how Python is applied to a wide range of tasks in development - and it‚Äôs not necessarily something related to ML or testing.

This is the second version of the course (as of 2021) and it was read only to [SPbPU](https://english.spbstu.ru/) students for now.
