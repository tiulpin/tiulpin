### Preparation

#### For the Chocolate Cake:

1. Preheat oven to 175°C (350°F). Grease two 9-inch cake pans, line with parchment rounds, and lightly flour them.

2. Combine 1 cup unsweetened almond milk with 1 tablespoon of vinegar. Stir slightly and set aside to curdle.

3. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

4. Add oil, applesauce, vanilla, and almond milk/vinegar mixture. Mix using a hand mixer or stand mixer on medium speed until well combined.

5. Reduce speed and carefully pour in the boiling water, mixing until the batter is smooth and runny.

6. Divide the batter evenly between the cake pans. Bake for 30–35 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool in pans for 10 minutes, then remove and let them cool completely before frosting.

#### For the Chocolate Buttercream Frosting:

1. In a large bowl, whisk cocoa powder to remove clumps.

2. Add softened vegan butter and mix with a hand mixer until creamy.

3. Gradually add half of the powdered sugar and half of the almond milk, mixing until combined. Add remaining powdered sugar and vanilla extract, mixing from low to high until fluffy.

4. Adjust consistency with more milk if too dry, or more powdered sugar if too wet.

5. Frost the cooled cake with an icing spatula or butter knife.
