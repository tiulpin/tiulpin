### Preparation

1. **Prepare the Yogurt:**  
   In a bowl, combine the Greek Yogurt with the minced Fresh Garlic and a pinch of salt. Let it sit for a few minutes to allow the garlic flavor to infuse.

2. **Poach the Eggs:**
    - Bring a pot of water to a gentle simmer (about 82Â°Câ€“88Â°C).
    - Add the White Vinegar to the water to help the egg whites coagulate.
    - Crack each egg into a small cup, then gently slide them into the simmering water one at a time.
    - Poach the eggs for 3â€“4 minutes until the whites are set but the yolks remain runny. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel.

3. **Make the Spiced Butter Sauce:**
    - In a small pan, melt the Unsalted Butter over medium heat.
    - Stir in the Paprika Powder and Red Pepper Flakes. Cook for about 1 minute until the sauce is fragrant. Remove from heat.

4. **Assemble the Dish:**
    - Spread the garlicky yogurt onto a serving plate.
    - Place the poached eggs on top of the yogurt.
    - Drizzle the warm spiced butter sauce over the eggs.
    - Garnish with chopped Fresh Dill or Parsley and a light drizzle of Extra Virgin Olive Oil.

5. **Serve:**  
   Enjoy your Turkish Eggs immediately for the best taste and texture!
