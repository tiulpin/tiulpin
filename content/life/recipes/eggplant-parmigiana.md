### Preparation

1. **Prepare the Eggplant**:
    - Thinly slice the eggplants and place them in a colander. Sprinkle lightly with salt and set aside for 1 hour to remove excess moisture, aiding in frying.

2. **Tomato Sauce**:
    - Finely chop the onion and sauté in a pan with olive oil until translucent and soft, without browning.
    - Add the tomato passata and torn basil leaves. Season with salt and pepper. Stir and let simmer gently for 10-15 minutes, then set aside.

3. **Fry the Eggplant**:
    - Rinse slices under cold water and pat dry with a towel. Lightly dust with flour, shaking off excess, and fry in sunflower oil for a few seconds on each side. Drain on kitchen paper to remove excess oil.

4. **Assemble the Parmigiana**:
    - Preheat oven to 180°C (350°F, gas mark 4). Use an 11×8 inch oval dish or similar size.
    - Spread a small amount of tomato sauce on the bottom of the dish to prevent sticking.
    - Layer eggplant slices, sprinkle parmesan, add mozzarella cubes, season with pepper, and add a few spoons of tomato sauce. Reserve ⅓ of the sauce for the top layer.
    - Repeat layers until one layer remains.

5. **Final Layer and Baking**:
    - Spoon remaining tomato sauce over the top layer, finishing with parmesan and mozzarella.
    - Cover loosely with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Remove foil and bake another 20 minutes until golden and bubbly on top.
    - Let it rest for 5 minutes before serving.
