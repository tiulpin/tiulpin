| **Product**             | **Amount**                   |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| Vanilla pudding         | as needed                    |
| Bananas                 | diced, soaked in lemon juice |
| Ladyfingers             | as needed                    |
| Whipped cream           | as desired                   |
| Cream cheese (optional) | as desired                   |

### Preparation

1. Prepare the vanilla pudding according to package instructions or your preferred recipe.

2. (Optional) Mix in cream cheese into the prepared pudding for an extra creamy texture.

3. Gently fold the whipped cream into the pudding mixture to add lightness.

4. In an oven dish or serving bowl, create a base layer with ladyfingers.

5. Place a layer of diced bananas over the ladyfingers. Ensure bananas are soaked in lemon juice to prevent browning.

6. Spread a layer of the pudding mixture over the bananas, followed by an additional layer of whipped cream if desired.

7. Repeat the layering process, ending with a final layer of pudding on top.

8. Crumble extra cookies over the top layer to garnish.

9. Let set in the refrigerator. The longer it chills, the softer the ladyfingers become, enhancing the desert's overall flavor.
