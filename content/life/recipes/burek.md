| **Product** | **Amount**                 |
|-------------|----------------------------|
| Filo pastry | 1 pack (500g, thin layers) |
| Feta cheese | 300-400g                   |
| Eggs        | 4                          |
| Yoghurt     | 100-150g                   |
| Baking soda | Â½ tsp.                     |
| Butter      | 150-200g                   |

### Preparation

1. Melt the butter in a bowl, ready for use in greasing and layering.

2. **Prepare the Filling**: In a separate bowl, use a fork to crumble the feta cheese into small chunks. Add eggs and yoghurt, mixing well while maintaining the chunky texture of the cheese. Stir in baking soda. Divide this filling mixture into three equal portions.

3. **Assembling**: Grease a baking tray lightly with some melted butter. Unroll the filo pastry pack, usually containing 16-20 layers. For the base, use 3â€“4 layers, brushing each one with the melted butter. Spread the first portion of filling over these layers.

4. Add another 2â€“3 buttered layers, followed by the second filling portion. Repeat with another 2-3 buttered layers and the third filling. Finish with 3â€“4 layers on top, ensuring there is air between layers for a fluffy burek.

5. **Important Step**: Prior to baking, cut the assembled burek into pieces, adding remaining butter between the sections. Avoid pressing down too hard during cutting to keep it fluffy.

6. **Baking**: Preheat the oven to 200Â°C (392Â°F). Bake the burek for 10 minutes with bottom heat only. Then switch to both top and bottom heat for an additional 20â€“30 minutes, until the top is golden brown. If the bottom isn't cooked thoroughly, switch back to bottom heat. If the top browns too quickly, cover with aluminum foil to prevent burning.

7. Once baked, sprinkle some water over the top and cover the tray with a towel. Let it sit for approximately a couple of hours to allow the flavors to meld.
