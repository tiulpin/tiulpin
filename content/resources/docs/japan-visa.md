> [!TIP]
> - This is a guide for getting a Japan Tourist Visa (Short-Term Stay) when applying in The Hague. I share this here since some folks have asked me about the process.
> - The [embassy's consular section page](https://www.nl.emb-japan.go.jp/itpr_en/e_consulate.html) is always up to date and the best source for current information.
> - Check [MOFA visa exemption list](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/short/novisa.html) – if your nationality isn't listed, you need a visa.
> - **Multiple-entry visa** can be granted on your first application if you demonstrate strong finances and travel history to other visa-required countries (US, UK, Schengen, etc.).

## Steps

1. **Gather required documents**
   - Prepare all documents listed below before visiting the embassy.

2. **Visit the embassy**
   - No appointment needed in the Netherlands; just arrive in the morning during visa section hours (Mon–Fri, 09:00–11:30).

3. **Submit application in person**
   - Hand in all documents at the visa counter.

4. **Wait for processing**
   - Standard processing takes 5-7 business days; peak seasons may take longer.

5. **Collect your passport**
   - Pick up your passport with the visa stamp from the embassy.

### Required docs

- [ ] Valid passport (at least 6-month validity beyond intended stay)
- [ ] Completed visa application form ([download from embassy website](https://www.nl.emb-japan.go.jp/itpr_en/r_visa_short.html))
- [ ] One recent photo (4.5 × 4.5 cm, white background, 80% face coverage)
- [ ] Flight reservation / round-trip ticket
- [ ] Hotel booking confirmation or invitation letter
- [ ] Detailed travel itinerary (each day must be listed)
- [ ] Proof of funds (bank statements in English, last 3–6 months) OR proof of employment or study (employment certificate, business registration, or student ID)

### For multiple-entry visa (first application)

To qualify for a multiple-entry visa on your first trip, additionally prepare:

- [ ] Stable employment proof (long tenure, good position) OR evidence of strong finances (higher bank balance, ~€10,000+ recommended)
- [ ] Copies of previous visas/stamps from visa-required countries (US, UK, Canada, Schengen, Australia, etc.)
- [ ] Brief cover letter explaining your future travel plans and reasons for requesting multiple-entry

An example cover letter (please, be creative!)

```
I am a citizen of [Country A] and a legal resident of [Country B], where I am employed on a permanent contract at Aperture Science Inc. I am firmly established in [City, Country B], where I live with my partner in our shared home. My stable employment and long-term residence constitute strong ties to [Country B] and a clear basis for my return after each trip.

My first visit to Japan is planned from [Start Date] to [End Date] ([Number of Days] days). During this trip, I intend to travel for tourism through [City 1], [City 2], and [City 3], together with my partner (who is submitting a separate visa application). A day-by-day itinerary, accommodation bookings, and a return flight reservation are included with this application.

Japan has long interested me for its traditions, architecture, and culture, and I would like to return for additional short visits over the next [1–3] years. A multiple-entry visa would support these plans by allowing travel without the need to submit a new application for each future trip.

I will finance all travel expenses from my own income and savings. Supporting documents, including bank statements and recent payslips, are attached. I fully understand and will comply with all Temporary Visitor conditions, including refraining from any paid work while in Japan, and departing Japan before the permitted stay expires on every visit.

### Fees

It was free for us in the Netherlands in February 2026.

> **Note:** Fees are paid in cash at the embassy. Check the [official fee page](https://www.nl.emb-japan.go.jp/itpr_en/r_tesuryo.html) for current rates.

## 🇳🇱 How it went in The Hague in my case

I submitted two applications for me and my partner on **Wednesday, February 11, 2026,** and was told to come back on the **19th**. 
We both received a **multiple-entry visa** valid for **three years**, allowing stays of up to 30 days per visit.

> **Applying for your partner with a [letter of proxy](https://www.nl.emb-japan.go.jp/files/100227239.pdf)**
> My partner didn't need to come to the embassy – I submitted her documents alongside mine using a letter of proxy. The process was the same; I just handed in both sets of documents at the counter and picked up both passports on the collection date.

**Tips for success:**
- Apply well in advance (at least a month before travel).
- Bring all original documents plus copies (some nationalities require two visa application forms)
- Having a [[resources/docs/us-visa|US Visa]] or [[resources/docs/canada-visa|Canada Visa]] may support your application.
- A detailed itinerary shows you have clear travel plans.
