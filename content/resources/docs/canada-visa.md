> [!TIP]
> - This is a guide for getting a Canada Visitor Visa (Temporary Resident Visa). I applied online and got my biometric appointment in The Hague, receiving my visa in just two weeks. I share this here since some folks have asked me about the process.
> - You can submit your application and biometrics **from any country** where a Canadian visa office or VFS center operates.
> - I liked the IRCC website a lot; it is user-friendly and has a good UI. So you can just skip this guide and follow the official instructions!

## Steps

1. **Check eligibility & start application**
   - Use IRCC’s “Come to Canada” tool, register/sign in (GCKey or partner), and begin IMM 5257.

2. **Gather documents & pay fees**
   - Scan passport bio‑page, digital photo, proof of funds, itinerary, etc., then pay CAD 100 (visitor visa) + CAD 85 (biometrics).

3. **Book & attend biometrics**
   - Schedule at your chosen VFS/visa‑office and provide fingerprints and photo (you do not need to make photos yourself).

4. **Track status online**
   - Monitor your IRCC account for approval and next steps.

5. **Submit passport & receive visa**
   - Mail or drop off your passport for stamping, then collect it or get it back via courier.

### Required docs

- [ ] Valid passport (at least 6 months beyond intended travel)
- [ ] Confirmation of completed IMM 5257 form
- [ ] Proof of funds (bank statements, payslips)
- [ ] Travel itinerary or invitation letter (I did not have an invitation letter, but I generated a travel itinerary with ChatGPT)
- [ ] Biometrics receipt
- [ ] Any additional documents requested in your application portal

## 🇳🇱 How it went in The Hague in my case

I applied online on **January 1, 2025**, and received an email invitation to book biometrics two days later. My VFS appointment in **The Hague** was set for **January 3**, where I spent about 10 minutes providing fingerprints and a photo. After submitting my passport for stamping, it was sent to London, where the visa was issued. I received my passport back on **January 19** with a multiple-entry visa valid until the passport expiration date.

> **About scheduling biometrics**  
> You choose your VFS location when paying the biometric fee. If you need to change it later, you must contact IRCC support; changing locations post‑payment can be cumbersome and may require a new fee payment.

**Tips for success:**
- Apply way before your travel date as some of my friends were waiting for many months.
- Having [[resources/docs/us-visa|US Visa]] helps to speed up the process.
