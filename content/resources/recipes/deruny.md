> [!NOTE]
> [Potato pancake](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato_pancake) – a vegan version of the popular Slavic dish. Can be nicely served with a sauce of your choice.

| **Product**   | **Amount**  |
|---------------|-------------|
| Peeled potato | 1kg         |
| Onions        | 2-3         |
| Flour         | 2-3 tbsp.   |
| Baking soda   | ¼ tsp.      |
| Spices        | as you wish |

### Preparation

1. Peel the potatoes and grate them. 
   - To prevent the pancakes from falling apart, grate half of the potatoes on a coarse grater and the other half on a fine grater.
2. Mix potatoes, flour, spices and baking soda.

> The dish will be more flavorful if you add finely chopped sun-dried tomatoes and paprika.

3. Fry the pancakes in vegetable oil in a well-heated frying pan for about 10 minutes.
