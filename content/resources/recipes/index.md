Some of the recipes I've tried and liked.
Some of them are my own, some are from friends, some are from the internet.
Also, I hate recipe websites, they are full of ads and pop-ups.

I'm not a chef, but I like to cook and bake (sometimes). 

All the recipes are vegetarian, some of them are vegan. 


I hope you'll find something interesting here. Enjoy!
